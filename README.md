# Support-Vector-Mechanism

# **Project Title** :
# Using support Vector Mechanism Algorithm of supervised super learning. Predict iris.csv dataset to find out whether the species is differnt or same.

# **Problem Statements** :
# An american based botonical granden grows Iris flower in they labs but using biotechnology in a single tree diffent types of variety flowers in grown.As a data science engineer find out how much accuracy is there in all categories which contain same species.

# **Task-1**: Preprocess the data in skit.learn library.
# **Task-2**: Load the data using sklearn model selection default arguments.
# **Task-3**: On the basis of the data train test and split the svm model.
# **Task-4**: Implement support vector mechanism _classifier.The svm must be "Liner".
# **Task-5**: Train the classifier on the training data.
# **Task-6**: Find out the prediction value on the data.
# **Task-7**: Test the model with the help of accuracy,accuracy should lie in the range of 0 to 1. 
# **Project Approach**

# **Conclusion**:
# According to my support vector mechanism model the species are liner with the accurancy of 1.00.
# Hence the model is successfully implement.
